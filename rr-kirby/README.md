# rr-kirby

Resonance Raman (RR) Kirby is the first stupid name that I came up with for a program that digests all of the different Gaussian output files that are of any use to study RR systems and spits out a neatly formatted spreadsheet on which to perform data analysis.
It may be the first step towards developing a statistical learning algorithm that is able to evaluate the usefulness of RR systems for us. Who knows?
