# gaussiantools

A collection of Python scripts to help me perform calculations and process data obtained using the computational chemistry suite Gaussian.

gaussiantools.py will be a Python module containing useful functions and classes.
The subdirectories will contain interesting scripts that aren't appropriate for a module or pieces of code that are but I haven't implemented yet.
