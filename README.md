# gaussiantools

A collection of Python scripts to help me perform calculations and process data obtained using the computational chemistry suite Gaussian.

Currently the most complete and interesting of these projects lives under the ```nics``` directory, which is a complete application designed to perform NICS calculation on molecules that have curved rings. It also contains a useful module called moleculetools.py, which holds a variety of functions that are useful for general work in chemical modelling.
